## How it Works
The aim for this repo is to enable a musical loop to be controlled using inputs from a car's OBD port, similarly to the effect of Mercedes' Sound Drive.

Currently, five loops are constantly playing. As adjustments are made to the car's current state (Steering angle, RPM, speed, etc), the volumes of each of the five loops will change.
